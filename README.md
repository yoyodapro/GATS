# Global Adaptive Time System (GATS)
The Global Adaptive Time System (GATS) is a novel approach to timekeeping that eliminates the need for daylight savings and takes into account factors such as Earth's orbit, axial tilt, and geographical location. GATS calculates a local time for each user based on their current position, resulting in a more accurate and personalized representation of the solar day.

Features:

- Eliminates the need for daylight savings adjustments
- Calculates local time based on Earth's orbit and axial tilt
- Personalized timekeeping according to the user's geographical location

Requirements:

- Python 3.6+
- astral library
- geopy library
- requests library

Usage:

- Install the required libraries by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

Run the script using python GATS.py.

The script will output the local GATS time for your current location.
