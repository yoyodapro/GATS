# Global Adaptive Time System (GATS)
The Global Adaptive Time System (GATS) is a novel approach to timekeeping that eliminates the need for daylight savings and takes into account factors such as Earth's orbit, axial tilt, and geographical location. GATS calculates a local time for each user based on their current position, resulting in a more accurate and personalized representation of the solar day.

The Global Adaptive Time System (GATS) eliminates traditional time zones by calculating local time for each individual based on their geographical location, rather than using predefined regions that share the same time offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This approach provides a more accurate representation of the solar day, as it takes into account Earth's orbit, axial tilt, and the user's specific position on Earth.

Traditional time zones are a simplified way of dividing the Earth into regions with a uniform time offset from UTC. However, this system does not account for variations in the solar day that occur due to Earth's orbit and axial tilt. The use of daylight saving time in some regions is an attempt to mitigate the impact of these variations, but it introduces additional complexity and can cause confusion.

GATS addresses these issues by dynamically calculating the local time for each user based on their current position. This eliminates the need for predefined time zones and daylight saving time adjustments. The result is a smooth and continuous transition of time as one moves across different geographical locations, which is a more accurate representation of the solar day.

In summary, GATS eliminates time zones by:

Calculating local time based on a user's specific geographical location, rather than using predefined time zones with fixed offsets from UTC.
Taking into account factors such as Earth's orbit and axial tilt, which affect the solar day.
Removing the need for daylight saving time adjustments, as the system dynamically adapts to the user's location and the solar day's natural variations.

Features:

- Eliminates the need for daylight savings adjustments
- Calculates local time based on Earth's orbit and axial tilt
- Personalized timekeeping according to the user's geographical location

Requirements:

- Python 3.6+
- astral library
- geopy library
- requests library

Usage:

- Install the required libraries by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

Run the script using python GATS.py.

The script will output the local GATS time for your current location.
